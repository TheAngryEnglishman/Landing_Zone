The petition project was a fun one for me, a light simple web application that combines the basics of frontend with some simple backend. In this project I really had fun experimenting with the styling and animations of the page. Introducing features such as Darkmode, allowed me to try out class based variables, and play around with transition effects.

The back-end was a good introduction to SQL and account security. SQL was used to save the users information and then served to the user when requested. Bcript was used to hash the user passwords for safe storage in the database. Going down the security rabbit hole was also an enjoyable experience, learning about salting and different hashing algorithms was rather interesting.
