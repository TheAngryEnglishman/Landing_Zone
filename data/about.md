I am a full-stack developer in my early twenties. I started my coding journey in Python, beginning with simple programs that would scrape the web for financial documents and compile them using Numpy and MatplotLib. It wasn't before long that I decided I wanted to pursue a career in this industry. I am currently attending a coding boot camp, where I am developing my full-stack skill set.
