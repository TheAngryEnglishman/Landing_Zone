This was an interesting one for me. This was my first time using a front end library, and so getting used to Vue and writing a single page application for the first time I found it challenging. Getting used to the syntax and learning about Vueâ€™s data and methods components took some time, and remembering to pass them along to each component took some getting used to, but, eventually I got there.

Looking back on the project I definitely see the advantages of single page applications and front-end libraries. It's definitely a case of struggle now, relax later on as learning a new library can be challenging. But, trying to implement this in pure javaScript would have become orders of magnitude harder, especially if I were to implement new features. It's almost as if that's why these libraries were created, who would have guessed?
